Testbench files only.

layer_2d is a testbench that integrates all modules (there is not separate module for that since the integration was done step by step using testbench). This is the testbench code for tracking 1 feature across 1 transition.
multi_features is a testbench that integrates all modules to process multiple features across one transition. 
Individual module testbenches have not been included since that was mostly ChatGPT generated. There are elements of ChatGPT in the above two as well, but not too much. The logic in the implementation and the architecture is completely original, to the best of my knowledge.
